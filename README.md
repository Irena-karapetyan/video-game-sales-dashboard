# 🎮 Video Game Genre Sales 

This project analyzes global video game sales by genre, region, and year.  
I used Python to clean the data and prepare visualizations in Tableau Public.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

All data cleaning was done in a Jupyter Notebook using pandas.  
Missing values were handled, and I created multiple summary tables used in Tableau:

- `top5_genres_global.csv`: Top 5 genres by global sales  
- `genres_by_region.csv`: Genre sales per region  
- `genre_region_share.csv`: Regional share of one genre  
- `genre_trend.csv`: Genre sales by year

These files are available in the `/data` folder.
